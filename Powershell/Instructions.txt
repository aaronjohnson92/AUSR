You need to install OpenSSH to make this work so you can go here

Or you can do the following:

1) Open powershell with elevated permissions.
2) Run Get-WindowsCapability -Online | ? Name -like 'OpenSSH*'
3) Run Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0

If you need to uninstall for any reason you can either

1) Open Settings.
2) Select Apps.
3) Select Features.
4) Select Manage Optional Features.
5) Select OpenSSH and then uninstall it.

or you can do the following:

1) Open powershell with elevated permissons.
2) Run Remove-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0


The installation info via powershell can be found here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse
